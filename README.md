## 🧠 Reflection

### ✅ Challenges Faced

- Handling form validation and conditional rendering using pure DOM methods
- Designing a fully responsive interface compatible with desktop and mobile devices

### 💡 Improvements (Future Enhancements)

- Implement **export/download as CSV** feature
- Enable **avatar/image upload** for employee profiles
- Migrate to a frontend framework like **React** or **Vue** for better component reusability and scalability
